checkNaN. 

Problems
- All quantities of some nuclides in MAT1282 (Average fuel slug) are NaN.
- At the point of nuclides
    - The incorrect nuclides includes: 
        - Cm242,
        - Cm246,
        - light nuclides whose mass number <= 100
    - All of the light nuclides appear in MAT1282.
    - Beside of MAT1282, the incorrect nuclides only includes:
        - Cm242, 
        - Cm246, 
        - Ni64
- At the point of quantities
    - The beta_total of Cm242 dominates
    - Most quantities of Cm246 are NaN, except Chi and velocity

Solutions
- Since the MAT1282 is "Average fuel slug", which is NOT used in the whole calculation
    - Reason: The supercell section of HWCR poison is the upper extension instead of the fuel slug
